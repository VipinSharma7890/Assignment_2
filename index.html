            Since, MCA is a postgraduate degree with a duration of two years, that
            meant for me to go deeper into the area of computer application 
            development using modern programming languages. This masterâ€™s degree is the ideal option 
            for me to build an advanced technical base while working with the latest technological 
            advancements and take me to area of app development, systems designing, computer networks, system 
            administration, database administration,, data mining, etc.
